Thinking about how to build a model. Started with a perhaps over-complicated model with separate objects: spindles, microtubules and kinetochores.

# 15/06/2018

Finessing the model. Decided to simplify it. Now I only keep kinetochores, each of them in a different attachment states. Then there are rulses of transformation between states. There is no time step, event times are generted from the exponential distribution.

Problems with the alternative model. Crashes on lateral attachment.
